# Walter Aulson's Italian Brainrot Mad Libs Comic Studio

A surreal, kid-friendly Mad Libs generator designed for Walter Aulson. It creates absurd, post-ironic "Italian Brainrot" style comic storyboards with narration using Google Gemini.

## Features
- **Mad Libs Engine**: 5 unique kid-friendly question packs with a wide-dashboard interface.
- **Italian Brainrot Style**: Automatically transforms names into silly pseudo-Italian versions (-ini, -ello, -ona).
- **Hyperrealistic AI Comic**: Generates 6-panel comic panels using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image.
- **AI Storytelling**: Narrative scripts generated by Gemini 3 Flash.
- **AI Voiceover**: Built-in browser Web Speech API for zero-cost, instant narration.
- **PG Safety**: Client-side filtering and strict AI system instructions.
- **Reset & Print**: "New Brainrot!" button for endless stories and "Print" support for physical comics.

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages (Free & Secure)

Since GitHub Pages is a static host, you cannot use traditional environment variables at runtime. To use your Gemini API Key securely (so it isn't stolen), you should inject it during the **Build Step** using GitHub Actions.

### 1. Get your API Key
Obtain a free-tier API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### 2. Add the Key to GitHub Secrets
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Click **New repository secret**.
4. Name: `API_KEY`.
5. Value: Paste your Gemini API key.

### 3. Setup the Build & Inject Workflow
Create a file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repo. This script will replace the `process.env.API_KEY` placeholder with your real secret before the site goes live:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - name: Install & Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
      - name: Inject API Key
        run: |
          # This replaces the string 'process.env.API_KEY' with your actual secret key
          # in the built JavaScript files.
          find dist -type f -name "*.js" -exec sed -i "s|process.env.API_KEY|\"${{ secrets.API_KEY }}\"|g" {} +
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './dist'
  deploy:
    needs: build
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Important Verification
After pushing your code, click the **Actions** tab on your GitHub repository. Ensure the workflow runs successfully (green checkmark). If it shows a red X, click it to see why it failed. Usually, it's just a typo in the Secret name.

## Technical Notes
- **Free Usage**: This app uses the Gemini Free Tier.
- **Privacy**: No user data is stored; all generation happens via secure API calls.
- **Style**: The "Hyperrealism" prompt ensures a high-quality cinematic look for all hybrid creatures.
